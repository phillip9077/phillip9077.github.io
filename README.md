# Welcome to my website!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I developed this React.js website as an entry point for recruiters to know more about me as a person outside of school and work. What you don't see in my resume is what you should see here, with more insight.

 As I learn more about JavaScript, React.js, and other frameworks, **I will be trying to improve this website** when I have time to optimize the UI/UX design (I am not a design major so bear with me :D) and to update my current information. 

I hope you enjoy the stay and I welcome any constructive feedback!
